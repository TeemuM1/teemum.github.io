        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <br>
        <p>On this page I'm going to list some things that I like to do on my free time.<p>
        <p>By now you have probably figured that I like to study web-developing because
              I'm not actuallly in any school yet.</p>
        <p>I've also played saxophone for almost 10 years. I really liked it but I had to 
              give it up since I had to go to the army, but I'm planning on continuing it later. </p>
        <p>Of course I also like to play video games. I usually play League of Legends, but
              I've played CS:GO the most. Me and my friends used to have a competitive team but we gave 
              it up after a while.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Games and Music</h2>
        <p>I previously listed some games that I like and also stated that I like to play video games.</p>
        <p>When I started playing saxophone I didn't instantly like it, but I began to like it when
              I got more experience.</p>
        <p>My older brother also likes music and he plays the guitar and has his own band too. I've
              played with him a couple of times.</p>
        <p>You could say that music lives in our blood</p>
        <p>We both also like video games and we both play League of Legends. Me and my brother
          both like to play the support role,</p>
        <p>and thats why my brothers friends call me and my brother the support mains.</p>
