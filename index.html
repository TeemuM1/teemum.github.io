        <h1>About</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Hi, my name is Teemu and at the moment I am 19 years old. This is my practice website
          where I just type some general stuff about me and my life.</p>
        <p>It may look a little boring now, but I'm planning on making it a bit more pleasant looking.</p>
        <p>I got the idea about my own website when I saw on a job application where you could link your own website.
          Then I just thought why not make one.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h1>Why?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>You may ask yourself why bother making a website just for a job application. Well it isn't the only reason.</p>
        <p>I've always been into computers and stuff, but lately I've been more interest in programming. I have a very basic discord bot
          that I made with python. It can send random pictures from a folder and also send random quotes.</p>
        <p>Now I find web-developing way more interesting than my discord bot so thats why I'm also practicing on how to make a website.</p>

        <br>

        <h1>Future</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I'm not sure yet what I'm gonna end up doing with this website. I may link it to a job application (not with this content though).</p>
        <p>Right now I'm just gonna keep on practicing and probably ask my friends what they think about it and ask for stuff
          that I could maybe add to make it better looking.</p>
        <p>One possible outcome is that I'm gonna use this as a portfolio as well. I'd just have to do some projects
          first</p>
