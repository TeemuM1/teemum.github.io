        I am a 19 year old boy who likes to play a lot of video games, eat and study. 
        I'm starting my studies in 2023 and I'm very excited.

        <p class="life">My whole life I've been into computers. It started as a 
          interest on video games. Then I started to play with my friends a lot. 
          Now that I've gotten older I'm more interested in programming and 
          especially web-developing.

        <h2 class="studies">My Studies</h2>
        <p class="studies">I graduated in 2022 and I was very happy and relieved that
          school was over for now. I applied to 3 different schools and all of them
          were perfect for me. I got into one of them and I was happy even though 
          it wasnt the one that I hoped for the most.
